<p>Disney weddings are unique and magical, and planners say that the level of detail that goes into each one varies depending on the couple’s preference. Some couples want complete control over every aspect of their wedding, while others prefer to rely on Disney’s expertise to take care of all the details.</p>
<p>No matter which route you choose, there are some key elements that are essential for any Disney wedding. One of the most important is choosing the right location – there are several amazing spots at Disney resorts for your ceremony and reception. You’ll also need to decide on a theme – perhaps something inspired by your favorite fairytale or movie? – and choose your wedding colors accordingly.</p>
<p>Once those basics are taken care of, the sky’s the limit when it comes to personalizing your wedding. Want Cinderella’s carriage to pick you up for your ceremony? No problem! How about a reception with Mickey and Minnie as your guests of honor? Anything is possible at a Disney wedding.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure where to start, don’t worry – Disney has experts on hand who can help you plan every detail of your big day. Or, if you’re wanting more autonomy in the planning process, they can provide resources and suggestions to get you started. Ultimately, it’s up to you how much or little help you want from Disney – either way, it’s sure to be a dream wedding!</p>
<h1 id="What-are-some-things-to-consider-when-planning-a-Disney-wedding"><a href="#What-are-some-things-to-consider-when-planning-a-Disney-wedding" class="headerlink" title="What are some things to consider when planning a Disney wedding?"></a>What are some things to consider when planning a Disney wedding?</h1><p>Disney weddings are becoming increasingly popular, as couples seek out unique and memorable wedding experiences. If you’re thinking of getting married at Disney, there are a few things you’ll want to consider.</p>
<p>First, you’ll need to decide what type of Disney wedding you want. Walt Disney World offers several different types of weddings, including intimate ceremonies in the Magic Kingdom and extravagant celebrations at Cinderella’s Castle. Disneyland also offers several different wedding packages, including ceremonies on Main Street USA and receptions in the park’s grand ballrooms.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll need to choose a date and reserve a space. Disney weddings tend to book up quickly, so it’s important to reserve a date as soon as possible. Spaces at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland fill up quickly during peak seasons, such as Christmas and summer months.</p>
<p>Third, you’ll need to choose your wedding party. Walt Disney World and Disneyland allow guests to choose up to four members of their wedding party. These individuals will have special privileges during the ceremony, such as being able to escort the bride down the aisle or standing with the couple during the ceremony.</p>
<p>Finally, you’ll need to decide on your wedding package. Walt Disney World offers three different types of wedding packages: Classic Romance, Dreams take Flight, and Happily Ever After. Each package includes different features, such as photography services, floral arrangements, and reception venues. Disneyland also offers three different wedding packages: Fairy Tale Weddings Signature Collection, Elaborate Events Collection, and Intimate Affairs Collection. Each package includes different features, such as photography services, floral arrangements, and reception venues.</p>
<p>Disney weddings are a unique and unforgettable way to celebrate your love story. By considering these five things when planning your Disney wedding, you can be sure that your day will be magical!</p>

There are many different types of professionals who can assist with the process, depending on your needs. Here is a breakdown of some of the most common event planners and what they can do to help make your occasion memorable.</p>

They can help with everything from choosing a venue and creating a budget to compiling guest lists and arranging catering. Some wedding planners also offer services such as design, coordination, and day-of coordination, which can be especially helpful if you’re working with a limited budget or timeline.</p>
<h1 id="Event-Planners"><a href="#Event-Planners" class="headerlink" title="Event Planners"></a>Event Planners</h1><p>Event planners work with clients for all types of occasions, not just weddings. They can help you choose a venue, select catering and entertainment, and handle all the logistics of your event. If you have specific ideas about what you want your event to look like, an event planner can often help bring them to life.</p>
<h1 id="Party-Planners"><a href="#Party-Planners" class="headerlink" title="Party Planners"></a>Party Planners</h1><p>Party planners focus exclusively on birthday parties, Sweet 16s, quinceañeras, and other special events for teenagers and young adults. They can help you pick a theme, plan the menu and drinks, select music and decorations, and more. They’re often well-versed in the latest trends in party planning and will be able to give you ideas that will make your celebration unique.</p>
<h1 id="Corporate-Event-Planners"><a href="#Corporate-Event-Planners" class="headerlink" title="Corporate Event Planners"></a>Corporate Event Planners</h1><p>If you’re planning a corporate event, such as a dinner or holiday party, you’ll need the help of a corporate event planner. These professionals specialize in planning events for businesses large and small. They can help with everything from selecting a venue to arranging transportation and choosing the right entertainment for your guests.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-included-in-a-Disney-wedding-package"><a href="#What-is-included-in-a-Disney-wedding-package" class="headerlink" title="What is included in a Disney wedding package?"></a>What is included in a Disney wedding package?</h1><p>When you think of a Disney wedding, what comes to mind? For many, visions of princes and princesses, fairy godmothers and talking animals come to mind. If you’re lucky enough to be able to have your wedding at a Disney resort, the sky is the limit in terms of what’s possible.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the bride and groom can choose from a range of different wedding packages. These packages can include just about everything you could dream of, from flowers and photos to a special ceremony location and reception meal. Basically, anything that you would need for your big day is included in these all-inclusive packages.</p>
<p>One popular option is the Fairytale Wedding Package. This includes a ceremony at Cinderella’s Castle with horse-drawn carriages taking you there and back. You also get use of an open-air pavilion for the reception with Cinderella coach lights overhead, as well as romantic floral arrangements for the site. The bride will also receive a special tiara costume to wear during the event!</p>
<p>If that’s not quite your style, how about a Pirates &amp; Princesses Wedding Package? This includes all the magic of a traditional Disney wedding, but with a fun pirate twist. The groom can even arrive by boat! As with other packages, this one includes nearly everything you could need, from flowers and photography to keepsake Mickey ears for everyone in attendance.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? If you’re dreaming of having your happily ever after at a Disney resort, start planning today!</p>
<h1 id="Are-there-any-restrictions-on-who-can-get-married-at-Disney"><a href="#Are-there-any-restrictions-on-who-can-get-married-at-Disney" class="headerlink" title="Are there any restrictions on who can get married at Disney?"></a>Are there any restrictions on who can get married at Disney?</h1><p>Disney is a popular place to get married, with its fairy-tale setting and plethora of resorts. But are there any restrictions on who can get married there?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, there are some restrictions on who can get married at Disney. For example, you must be 18 years or older to get married without parental consent in Florida. If you are under 18, you need the consent of both parents or legal guardians to marry.</p>
<p>In addition, Disney has other restrictions in place depending on which resort you choose to get married at. For example, at the Disneyland Resort in California, only heterosexual couples can get married. However, at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida and Disneyland Paris, same-sex couples are welcome to wed.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking to say “I do” at one of the most magical places on earth, be sure to check out the specific restrictions for your chosen Disney resort.</p>
