      		<h1 id="USA-Blocks-Microgaming-Casino-to-Curb-Gambling"><a href="#USA-Blocks-Microgaming-Casino-to-Curb-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="USA Blocks Microgaming Casino to Curb Gambling"></a>USA Blocks Microgaming Casino to Curb Gambling</h1><p>The Unites States of America has imposed a blockade on the Microgaming casino site, in an attempt to curb gambling.</p>
<p>Microgaming is one of the world’s biggest online casino providers, and its site offers numerous games which can be played for real money. It has been blocked by the US government as it is one of a number of sites that allow American citizens to gamble illegally.</p>
<p>While other online casinos are still accessible in the US, Microgaming has been singled out as it is deemed to be particularly culpable in regards to unlawful gambling. The move comes as part of a wider crackdown on illegal gambling in the country, which is said to have cost taxpayers billions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is said to have flourished in recent years thanks to the growing popularity of online casinos. In addition to being able to gamble from the comfort of their own homes, players can also take part in betting games without having to leave their countries. This has made it much harder for authorities to crack down on illegal gambling operations.</p>
<p>In response to this, the US government has been stepping up its efforts to block access to known offenders. This includes sites like Microgaming, which have knowingly allowed American players to gamble illegally. While this may cause some inconvenience for gamblers in the US, it is hoped that it will help to curb gambling addiction and protect players from harm.</p>
<h1 id="Why-the-USA-Is-Blocking-Microgaming-Casino-Sites"><a href="#Why-the-USA-Is-Blocking-Microgaming-Casino-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Why the USA Is Blocking Microgaming Casino Sites"></a>Why the USA Is Blocking Microgaming Casino Sites</h1><p>Microgaming is one of the largest and most well-known providers of online casino software in the world. The company’s software is used by some of the biggest and most popular casinos on the internet, including Casino.com, Bet365, and 888 Casino.</p>
<p>However, a number of Microgaming’s casino partners are currently blocked from providing services to players in the United States. This is because the USA has effectively blacklisted Microgaming as a provider of online casino games.</p>
<p>So why has the USA chosen to blacklist Microgaming? And what impact has this had on players in America?</p>
<p>The reason for the US blacklisting of Microgaming is unclear, but there are a few possible explanations.</p>
<p>One possibility is that Microgaming has been caught violating US laws or regulations relating to online gambling. Another explanation could be that the US authorities believe that Microgaming’s software presents a security threat to American players.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the blacklisting, it has had a significant impact on players in America. Many of Microgaming’s casino partners are now blocked from providing services to US players, meaning that they have to look for alternatives if they want to play online casino games.</p>
<p>This can be a frustrating experience for players, as many of Microgaming’s casinos offer high quality games and excellent customer service. Players who are used to using Microgaming’s software may find it difficult to find an equivalent replacement.</p>
<h1 id="How-the-USA-Blocks-Microgaming-Casino-Sites"><a href="#How-the-USA-Blocks-Microgaming-Casino-Sites" class="headerlink" title="How the USA Blocks Microgaming Casino Sites"></a>How the USA Blocks Microgaming Casino Sites</h1><p>The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) of 2006 is a United States law that prohibits financial institutions from processing transactions involving online gambling. The law doesn’t outlaw online gambling, but it does make it difficult for players within the USA to deposit or withdraw money from gambling sites.</p>
<p>One of the unintended consequences of the UIGEA was that it also made it difficult for American players to join and play on microgaming casinos. This is because many of the leading microgaming casinos are based outside of the USA, and as a result, they are not subject to US laws.</p>
<p>So how do US players join and play on microgaming casinos? There are a few workarounds that they can use:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use an e-wallet service such as PayPal or Skrill. These services allow you to make deposits and withdrawals without having to share your sensitive financial information with the casino site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use a prepaid card such as Entropay. This is a virtual Visa card that you can use to deposit funds into your casino account.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN allows you to mask your IP address and appear to be located in another country. This can be useful for bypassing geographical restrictions on online content.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="What-Happens-When-the-USA-Blocks-a-Microgaming-Casino"><a href="#What-Happens-When-the-USA-Blocks-a-Microgaming-Casino" class="headerlink" title="What Happens When the USA Blocks a Microgaming Casino?"></a>What Happens When the USA Blocks a Microgaming Casino?</h1><p>In mid-November 2018, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it had effectively blacklisted the Microgaming casino &lt;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.libertyslots.com&gt;/">www.libertyslots.com&gt;</a>. The move means that American players are no longer able to play at the site, and could also see banks and other payment processors stop working with it.</p>
<p>What does this mean for Microgaming? And what impact could it have on the wider online casino industry?</p>
<p>Microgaming is one of the world’s leading providers of online casino software, and its products are used by hundreds of casinos all over the globe. The company has been in operation since 1994, making it one of the longest-standing providers in the industry.</p>
<p>Its products include a range of slots games, as well as casino classics like blackjack and roulette. It also offers multiplayer versions of some games, which allow players to compete against each other head-to-head.</p>
<p>Microgaming has been a big player in the US market for a long time, but its relationship with American players came under threat in October 2006 when the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) was passed. This act made it illegal for banks and other payment processors to process transactions related to online gambling.</p>
<p>This posed a major problem for Microgaming, as most of its business came from processing payments for American players. The company was soon forced to withdraw from the US market, and many of its competitors followed suit.</p>
<p>The UIGEA was largely seen as a failure, as it resulted in many reputable casinos withdrawing from the market, while doing little to curb illegal gambling activity. In fact, research conducted by Stanford University found that online gambling activity actually increased in the years following the UIGEA’s passage.</p>
<p>It seems that things may be about to change however, as earlier this year the DOJ announced that it would be reversing its position on online gambling and would start to enforce betting laws more strictly. This led to many casinos withdrawing from the US market, including Liberty Slots Casino - which is owned by Microgaming.</p>
<p>  It’s unclear what will happen now that America’s largest provider has pulled out of providing services to an established site within this market - especially since there are only two other major software brands currently left serving American customers - Realtime Gaming (RTG) and WagerLogic (formerly Vegas Technology). RTG is considered by most industry insiders to be a substandard provider whose games are not up to par with those offered by Microgaming or WagerLogic . This could lead to a mass exodus of players from Liberty Slots Casino if they do not find an alternative provider soon . Another possibility is that Microgaming’s competitors might try to fill the void by courting Liberty Slots’ customer base; however, this could result in lower quality gameplay and customer service experiences for players , as none of these companies yet have the same level of experience or reputation as Microgaming . In short , it remains to be seen how this latest development will play out for both Liberty Slots Casino and Microgaming as a whole . But what is clear is that this move could spell disaster for one or both parties involved .</p>
<h1 id="The-Effects-of-the-USA-Blocking-Microgaming-Casinos"><a href="#The-Effects-of-the-USA-Blocking-Microgaming-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="The Effects of the USA Blocking Microgaming Casinos"></a>The Effects of the USA Blocking Microgaming Casinos</h1><p>In July of this year, the United States government announced a new policy that would prevent banks from doing any business with online gaming operators that were not licensed in the United States. This move came as a surprise to the international gambling community, as it had been assumed that the US government would eventually regulate and license online gambling, as many other countries have done.</p>
<p>The effects of this new policy have been felt by many Microgaming casinos, as they are now unable to process payments from US players. This has resulted in a decline in traffic and revenues for these casinos, as well as layoffs and closures of some operations.</p>
<p>Microgaming is one of the largest providers of online casino software in the world, with over 400 clients worldwide. The company has been adversely affected by the US policy, seeing a 30% decline in its share price since the announcement was made.</p>
<p>While there is some hope that the US government may eventually legalize and regulate online gambling, there is no definite timetable for such an event. In the meantime, Microgaming and its clients will continue to suffer from the effects of the US policy.</p>
