#  Century Casino Dumas Sold to New Owner

The Century Casino Dumas has a new owner, as announced on the casino’s website. The new owner is listed as Cascades Casino Resort LP, which is a subsidiary of the Great Canadian Gaming Corporation.

The Century Casino Dumas has been in operation since 2003 and has been a popular destination for locals and tourists alike. The casino is home to over 900 slot machines and a variety of table games. It also offers a buffet and a steakhouse.

There is no word yet on what changes, if any, will be made to the casino under its new ownership. However, it is likely that the casino will remain open for business as usual for the time being.

The Century Casino Dumas is one of several casinos that Great Canadian Gaming Corporation owns in Alberta. The company also owns casinos in Fort McMurray, Leduc, Wetaskiwin, Calgary, and Edmonton.

#  Century Casino Dumas Up for Sale

The century casino Dumas has been put up for sale by its current owner, the MD Anderson Cancer Center. The cancer center has owned the casino since 2011 when it purchased it from a local family.

The casino is located in downtown Dumas and features a 40,000 square-foot gaming floor with 400 slot machines and 18 table games. It also has a 24-hour restaurant, bar, and coffee shop.

According to the MD Anderson Cancer Center, the decision to sell the casino was made as part of a strategic plan to focus on its core mission of fighting cancer.

"As we looked at our overall strategic plan, we determined that selling the Century Casino would be in the best interest of our organization and would support our core mission," said Dan Fontaine, president and CEO of MD Anderson Cancer Center.

A Request for Proposals (RFP) has been issued and interested buyers are invited to submit their proposals by May 22nd.



When the MD Anderson Cancer Center bought the century casino Dumas for $7 million back in 2011, many people were skeptical about their motives. And now, with news of them putting it back up for sale just eight years later, those suspicions have only grown stronger.

It's not hard to see why people might be suspicious; after all, why would a cancer center want to own a casino? The answer is actually quite simple – money. In fact, according to some reports, the purchase of the century casino Dumas was one of the most profitable investments that MD Anderson Cancer Center had ever made.

But now that they've decided to sell it again, many people are wondering what this means for the future of the century casino Dumas. Will it be bought by another casino operator who will continue to run it as is? Or will it be turned into something else entirely? Only time will tell…

#  Who Owns Century Casino Dumas?

In December of 2014, the Century Casino Dumas was sold to a new ownership group. The new group is made up of local investors from the Dumas area. Who exactly owns this casino is still a bit of a mystery, but it's clear that the locals are excited about the change in ownership.

The previous owner had been in charge of the casino since it first opened in 1998. He had been looking to sell it for quite some time and finally found a buyer late last year. The new group has big plans for the casino and is eager to get started on renovations and improvements.

There's no word yet on what changes will be made, but the new owners are promising that there will be plenty of them. They're also pledging to keep all of the current employees on staff and to make sure that the casino remains a part of the community.

It's unclear why the previous owner decided to sell, but it's clear that this is great news for both the casino and the community as a whole. The new ownership group has already shown its dedication to making things better and we can only hope that they continue to do so in the future.

#  Casino Sold, Owner Unnamed
The casino that was for sale for the past few months has been sold, but the new owners remain unnamed. The casino is a popular destination for tourists in the state and has been in operation for over two decades.

When asked for a comment, the previous owner declined to give a statement, saying that they were no longer affiliated with the casino in any way. It is unknown what the new ownership has planned for the property, but they are expected to make an announcement in the coming weeks.

In the meantime, employees of the casino say that they are anxious about their future and what this might mean for them. The casino employs hundreds of people and provides a vital service to the community. Many are worried about whether or not they will be able to keep their jobs under new ownership.

The sale of the casino comes as a surprise to many, as it was thought to be doing well financially. However, it is speculated that the new owners may have plans to redevelop the property into something else. This could mean big changes for the area and its residents.
