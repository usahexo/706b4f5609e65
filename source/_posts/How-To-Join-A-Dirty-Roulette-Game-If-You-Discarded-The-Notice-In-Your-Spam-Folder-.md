#  How To Play A Dirty Roulette Game 

If you want to add a touch of excitement to your party or just spice things up in the bedroom, then a dirty roulette game is a great way to do it! This article will teach you how to play.

To start, everyone playing the game needs to sit in a circle. One person is chosen to be the dealer and they will deal out cards face down until each player has two cards. The player with the highest card becomes the banker for the first round. The banker can either keep their card or give it to another player. 

The banker then deals out two more cards face down, one to themselves and one to another player. If those two cards are equal, then the players involved switch places. If not, the player with the higher card takes both of the new cards. The player who ends up with the two highest cards is automatically out of the game.

The banker now deals out one card face up, called the turning card. The player to their left starts by flipping over their first card- if it’s higher than the turning card, they take the pot. If it’s lower, they pass it on to the next player who flips over their first card etc., until someone flips over a higher card and takes the pot. If at any time flipping over your first card reveals that you would have lost (e.g. if your first card was an eight and the turning card was a two) then you must put all of your money into the pot. 

The game continues like this, with players flipping over two cards at a time until one person has no more cards left- this person is then designated as winner and gets all ofthe money in the pot.

- Practice makes perfect! If possible, try out some free practice tables at home before heading to a casino. This will give you a better understanding of how the game works and increase your chances of winning when you finally sit down at a real table.
