#  Zambia Ranks Second in Africa for Sport Betting Activity 

According to a study by the Sports Betting Intelligence (SBI) of London, Zambia is the second country in Africa with the highest sport betting activity. The study was released in March, 2018, and it showed that 62 percent of Zambians have placed at least one bet in the past year. This is just below South Africa which has a 63 percent betting activity.

The betting industry is worth an estimated $2 billion a year in Africa, and it is growing rapidly. The reason for the high percentage of Zambians who bet is because there are many opportunities to do so. There are numerous sports betting companies operating in the country, as well as many illegal bookmakers.

Most Zambians who bet do so through informal channels such as friends or family members. This can be risky, as there is no guarantee that they will get their money back if they lose. In addition, there is no protection if something goes wrong.

There has been an effort to regulate the gambling industry in Zambia, but this has met with resistance from some operators. They argue that more regulation will drive business underground and make it more difficult to enforce gambling laws.

The government says it wants to ensure that citizens have a safe and fair experience when they bet, and that they are not taken advantage of by unscrupulous operators. It plans to introduce new regulations later this year which will include banning people under the age of 18 from gambling and regulating how advertising can be carried out.

#  Online Sports Betting Continues to Grow in Zambia 

The Zambian economy is growing, and with that, the country’s sports betting industry is also expanding. In Zambia, as in many other countries around the world, online sports betting is a big business. And it continues to grow in popularity, thanks to the wide range of betting options now available as well as the convenience of placing bets online.

#  Gambling on Sports is a Major Industry in Zambia

Gambling has been a part of the Zambian culture for centuries. Across the country, there are numerous betting shops and casinos where people can place bets on a variety of sporting events. Soccer is the most popular sport to gamble on, but people also bet on cricket, rugby, and tennis matches.

The gambling industry in Zambia is worth an estimated $1.2 billion per year, with around 60% of the population participating in some form of gambling. The government has tried to regulate the industry in recent years, but with limited success. There are concerns that gambling is addictive and leads to financial instability and crime, but most Zambians see it as a harmless pastime.

The biggest operators in the Zambian gambling industry are Lottotech and Bet24/7. Lottotech is a state-owned company that operates 12 betting shops across the country. Bet24/7 is a private company that operates over 100 betting shops. Both companies offer a wide range of sports betting options, as well as casino games such as roulette and blackjack.

There are also numerous online gambling sites that accept bets from Zambians. These sites include Zambookie, which offers odds on all major sporting events, and M-Pesa Games, which specialises in mobile gaming applications.

The gambling industry in Zambia has been growing rapidly in recent years. This is partly due to the increasing availability of online gambling platforms, but it is also fuelled by the country's strong economy and expanding middle class. The government has been trying to get more involved in regulating the industry, but so far there has been limited success.
