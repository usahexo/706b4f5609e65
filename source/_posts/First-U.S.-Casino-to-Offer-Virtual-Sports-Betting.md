#  First U.S. Casino to Offer Virtual Sports Betting

As of September 6th, the first U.S. casino to offer virtual sports betting is the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, New Jersey. This new development comes as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in May to strike down PASPA, a law that had prevented states from authorizing sports betting.

The Meadowlands Racetrack will offer both in-person and online betting on virtual races and sporting events. These events will be simulated, but will use real-life data to create as realistic an experience as possible. Bettors will be able to bet on things like who will win a particular game or race, what the margin of victory will be, and how many points one team will win by.

While other casinos around the country are also gearing up to offer sports betting, the Meadowlands Racetrack is the first to do so with virtual sports. This could be a major draw for bettors who want to get in on the action but don't want to risk their money on real-life games. It could also appeal to those who want to bet on events that don't take place in their locality or that they can't attend in person.

Virtual sports have been growing in popularity in recent years, and this move by the Meadowlands Racetrack shows that they are taking them seriously as a gambling option. With more and more states legalizing sports betting, it's likely that other casinos will soon begin offering virtual sports as well.

#  Wynn Las Vegas Adds Virtual Sports Betting

The Wynn Las Vegas has announced that it will be adding virtual sports betting to its casino floor. The new addition will be available starting November 1st and will include a variety of wagering options on simulated sporting events.

"We're always looking for new and innovative ways to improve the guest experience," said Maurice Wooden, president of Wynn Las Vegas. "Virtual sports are becoming increasingly popular, and we're excited to offer this unique form of entertainment to our guests."

The virtual sportsbook at Wynn Las Vegas will offer a range of betting options on simulated sporting events, including football, horse racing, tennis, and auto racing. Guests will be able to place wagers on individual matchups or entire tournaments, and can choose from a variety of betting styles, including straight bets, parlays, teasers, and props.

In addition to the sportsbook at Wynn Las Vegas, the casino will also offer a dedicated area for virtual racing. This will include a simulator that allows guests to race against each other in real time. The race track can accommodate up to eight players simultaneously.

"With virtual sports betting and racing now available at Wynn Las Vegas, we provide our guests with two unique forms of entertainment that can't be found anywhere else in town," said Wooden. "We think this will be a big hit with our guests and look forward to offering these exciting new attractions."

#  Caesars Entertainment Adds Virtual Sports Betting

On October 10, 2017, Caesars Entertainment Corporation (CZR) announced it had agreed to terms to purchase the social casino game developer Playtika Ltd. for $5.1 billion. This move signals Caesars' entry into the virtual sports betting market.

The global virtual sports betting market is expected to grow from $2.9 billion in 2016 to $11.8 billion by 2021, according to a report by MarketsandMarkets. In announcing the Playtika acquisition, Caesars CEO Mark Frissora said that "the combination of Caesars' world-class gaming and hospitality offerings with Playtika's highly popular social casino games will create a player experience that is unmatched in the industry."

Virtual sports are video games that simulate traditional sports such as football, horse racing, and car racing. Bettors can bet on the outcome of these simulated events just as they would bet on an actual sporting event. Virtual sports have become increasingly popular in recent years as they offer a convenient way to gamble without having to leave home.

Caesars seems poised to capitalize on this growth trend. The company has a large global footprint with properties in over a dozen countries. In addition, it has a deep bench of experienced casino executives who can help develop and market new virtual sports products.

The key question for investors is whether or not virtual sports betting will cannibalize revenue from traditional casino gaming products. In his statement announcing the Playtika acquisition, Frissora noted that "a small percentage of our customers currently participate in virtual sports betting." He believes that there is room for both traditional casino gaming and virtual sports betting products to grow simultaneously.

That may be true in the long run, but there could be some short-term cannibalization as consumers switch over to gambling on virtual sports events instead of playing traditional casino games. Investors should keep an eye on how much growth virtual sports betting contributes to Caesars' overall business going forward.

#  MGM Resorts International Adds Virtual Sports Betting

#

In a move to expand its online betting options, MGM Resorts International has announced the launch of virtual sports betting. This new service will allow customers to bet on simulated sports events, including horse racing, car racing, and soccer.

#

Virtual sports have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their immersive and realistic experience. Bettors can now place bets on these virtual events just as they would in traditional sports betting, making it a convenient option for those who want to wager on sports without having to follow a real-life sport.

#

MGM Resorts International is one of the first major casino companies to offer virtual sports betting, and it is clear that they see this as a lucrative opportunity. The company has already partnered with several software providers in order to offer a variety of virtual sports betting options.

#

It is expected that MGM Resorts International's virtual sports betting service will be popular among bettors in the United States and around the world. The company has already seen success with its online casino platform, and it is likely that the addition of virtual sports will only add to that.

#  Atlantic City Casinos Add Virtual Sports Betting

Atlantic City casinos have been struggling in recent years, but they may have found a new way to bring in customers: virtual Sports betting.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Hard Rock Casino and Resort announced that it would be adding virtual sports betting to its offerings. The casino will offer bets on simulated horse and car races, as well as other sporting events.

“It is an exciting time here at the Hard Rock as we continue to elevate the customer experience with innovative products and services that cannot be found anywhere else in Atlantic City,” said Hard Rock CEO Jim Allen.

Other casinos are expected to follow suit, adding virtual sports betting to their own offerings. This could help revive Atlantic City’s casino industry, which has been struggling in recent years.

In 2016, revenue from casinos in Atlantic City was down 3 percent from the year before. This was largely due to increased competition from casinos in other states, such as Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

Virtual sports betting could help turn things around for Atlantic City’s casinos. According to a study by the European Gaming and Betting Association, virtual sports betting generates about twice as much revenue as traditional sports betting.

This is because people who bet on virtual sporting events are more likely to do so multiples times throughout the day, rather than just once before a big game. This means that there is more potential for profit from virtual sports betting than traditional sports betting.



With online gambling now legal in New Jersey, it was only a matter of time before Atlantic City's casinos added Virtual Sports Betting to their line-up of games! I don't often gamble but when I do I love trying my luck on Virtual Sports Bets - there's something about watching those digital horses or cars race past that just gets my heart racing (pun intended). And with this new development, AC's casinos are sure to see a surge in traffic!
