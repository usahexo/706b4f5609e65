#  Poker Pro Claims He Can Earn 10k in 10 Hours at Betway

#

Yes, you read that correctly. Professional poker player Stephen Chidwick has boldly claimed that he can earn £10,000 in just 10 hours by playing at Betway. The 26-year-old Englishman is one of the most successful poker players in the world and is currently ranked fourth on the global all-time money list.

When asked how he could achieve such an impressive feat, Chidwick simply replied: "With a lot of hard work and a bit of luck." He then added: "I'm feeling confident and I think I can take down some big pots at Betway."

If Chidwick's prediction is correct, it would mean he could earn an hourly rate of £1,000 - which is surely an appealing prospect for any professional gambler. In fact, Betway has already placed a £10,000 bounty on Chidwick's head, so there's certainly plenty of incentive for him to come out on top.

The question now is whether Chidwick can back up his bold statements with some quality gameplay. Given his track record, it would be foolish to bet against him!

#  PokerStars Player Smashes Record for 10k Hands in 10 Hours

In a recent session of play at PokerStars, one of the site's top players obliterated the record for 10,000 hands played in 10 hours.

The player in question, who goes by the screen name "girinda" on the site, began the challenge at 05:00 EDT on Sunday and finished just after 15:00 EDT – playing an average of one hand every six seconds.

The previous record was held by Belgium's "patpatman", who completed 10,000 hands in 11 hours and 41 minutes in February of this year. That's an average of one hand every 11 seconds.

girinda was gracious in victory, tweeting "I can't believe it. I set a new world record for 10k hands in 10 hours at PokerStars!" shortly after completing the challenge.

This latest achievement is just another milestone in what has been a stellar year for girinda on PokerStars. In June he won a $2,500 buy-in tournament for over $100,000, following up that result with two second-place finishes in high-roller events worth more than $250,000 each.

#  Time Magazine: Why I Quit My Job to Play Poker

I'm a 29-year-old professional who, up until recently, worked an exciting job in the tech industry. I was well compensated and had a promising career ahead of me. However, in January of this year, I walked away from it all to play poker full-time. It wasn't an easy decision to make, but it was the right one for me.

People often ask me why I made such a drastic change and if I'm worried about my future. The answer is that I'm not worried at all. In fact, I'm confident that making this switch will provide me with a better quality of life than my previous job ever could.

There are a few reasons why playing poker has become a more attractive option for me than working a traditional job. First and foremost, poker is a much more enjoyable way to make money than working a 9-to-5. It's also considerably more profitable. With a good win rate, I can make as much or more money playing poker than I ever could working my old job.

Another major reason I quit my job to play poker is because it gives me more freedom and flexibility. I can now work from anywhere in the world as long as I have an internet connection. This is perfect for someone like me who loves to travel.

Lastly, playing poker allows me to control my own destiny in a way that no other career can match. If I put in the hard work and make some smart decisions, there's no reason why I can't be successful at this game. Contrast that with my previous job where there were countless factors outside of my control that could lead to failure.

While making the switch from traditional employment to playing poker full-time isn't right for everyone, it's been the right decision for me. If you're considering doing something similar, I encourage you to do your research and go for it!
