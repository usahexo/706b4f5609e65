#  Poker Tournament Play to Resume Saturday

The remaining players in the $1,500 buy-in poker tournament at the Rio Casino in Las Vegas will resume play Saturday, with the goal of declaring a winner.

Defending champion Christian Pham has a commanding chip lead going into the final day of play, with more than twice the chips of his nearest competitor. But as anyone who has watched poker knows, anything can happen.

There are still plenty of quality players left in the field, including Benny Glaser, Chance Kornuth and Fedor Holz. All three have already won major titles in their careers.

Glaser is looking to make amends for a devastating loss late on Friday night. He was heads-up for the title when his queen-ten lost to Pham’s ace-king.

Saturday’s action is scheduled to get underway at 2 p.m. local time.
