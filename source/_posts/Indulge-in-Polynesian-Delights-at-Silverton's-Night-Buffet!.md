#  Sample the best of Polynesia at Silverton Casino's Night Buffet

Las Vegas is a city that is always alive with a never-ending party atmosphere. No matter what time of day or night it is, there is always something to do in this city that never sleeps. While most people think of the Strip when they think of Las Vegas, there is another side to this city that many people don't know about. Just off the beaten path is an area called Downtown Las Vegas.

Downtown Las Vegas is where all of the casinos that aren't on the Strip are located. This area is filled with vintage casinos and hotels, each with its own unique history. While some of these casinos have been remodeled and updated over the years, there are still plenty of them that have that old school Vegas charm. One of the best things about Downtown Las Vegas is that it's a lot less touristy than the Strip, so you can actually enjoy a more authentic Vegas experience here.

One of my favorite things to do in Downtown Las Vegas is to eat at one of the amazing buffets. There are buffets located all throughout the area, but one of my favorites is at Silverton Casino. Not only does Silverton Casino offer an amazing buffet, but it also has an aquarium right inside it! There's nothing quite like eating breakfast while watching tropical fish swim by.

The buffet at Silverton Casino offers a wide variety of food options from all over the world. You'll find everything from Mexican to Italian to Asian cuisine here. And if that's not enough for you, they also have a dessert bar that will make your sweet tooth happy! I could honestly spend hours indulging in all of the delicious food options at this buffet.

If you're looking for a unique and tasty dining experience while in Las Vegas, be sure to head over to Silverton Casino and check out their amazing buffet!
