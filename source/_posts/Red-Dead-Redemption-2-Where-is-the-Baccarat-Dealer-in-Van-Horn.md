#  Red Dead Redemption 2: Where is the Baccarat Dealer in Van Horn?

If you're looking for the Baccarat Dealer in Van Horn, you'll want to head to the far southwestern corner of the map. There, you'll find a small casino called The Gem Saloon. This is where you'll find the Baccarat Dealer.

The Gem Saloon is a small, run-down casino that's mostly frequented by locals. It's not the most glamorous place in the world, but it does have a few tables and gaming machines that can be fun to play around on.

The Baccarat Dealer can be found at the back of the casino, near the bathrooms. He's a small, wiry man with a thick beard and piercing eyes. He always looks like he's in a hurry, and he's not very talkative.

If you'd like to play some baccarat with the dealer, be sure to bring some money - he doesn't accept player bets for free.

#  Van Horn's Baccarat Dealer Missing!

The renowned baccarat dealer of the prestigious Van Horn casino, Mr. Simmons, has been reported missing by his colleagues. This comes as quite a shock to the casino staff as well as the many guests who frequent the gambling hall.

Mr. Simmons was last seen at his post dealing cards to gamblers at around 10 PM on Tuesday night. When he failed to show up for work the next day, colleagues became concerned and began searching for him. It wasn't until later that evening when they found his belongings scattered about his work station, leading them to believe that he had abruptly left in a hurry.

Police were notified and are currently investigating the matter, but so far they have no clues as to what may have happened to Mr. Simmons. His disappearance is baffling to both family and friends as well as those who know him from the casino; he is described as a reliable and conscientious worker who has never shown any signs of having any personal problems.

Despite this shocking turn of events, Van Horn's baccarat tables are still open for business and guests are encouraged to come and enjoy a game or two in remembrance of Mr. Simmons.

The small town located in the Texas Panhandle has seen a sudden surge in visitors since the casino opened about a year ago, and the locals are largely dependent on the income the casino brings in.

"I don't know what we're going to do without that money."

The sheriff's department is currently investigating the disappearance, and so far they have no leads. However, they are urging anyone with any information about the missing dealer to come forward. "We're doing everything we can to find out what happened," said Sheriff Tom O'Donnell. "But we need help from the community. If you know anything, please come forward and let us know."

In the meantime, the casino is remaining tight-lipped about what may have happened to their employee. "We're just as worried as everyone else in town," said a spokesperson for the casino. "We hope and pray that he turns up safe and sound."

As of now, there is no word on when or if the casino will reopen.
