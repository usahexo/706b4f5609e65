#  What are Pocket Games Soft?

Pocket games soft are those video games which can be played on a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet computer. They are typically small and simple to play, making them ideal for short gaming sessions when on the go.

The term “pocket games soft” was coined in the early 2010s to describe the then-new generation of mobile phone games that were playable on devices with smaller screens, such as the iPhone and iPad.

While some high-profile AAA console titles have made their way to mobile devices in recent years (including Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas), the majority of pocket games soft titles tend to be small indie productions that often eschew high production values in favour of tight gameplay mechanics and simple but addictive gameplay loops.
