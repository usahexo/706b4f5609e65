#  What is the Age of Onset for Problem Gambling? Augustus Game Study Says it Begins at 25

According to a study recently published in Augustus, the age of onset for problem gambling is 25. The study was conducted using a large sample of over 16,000 individuals from around the world.

The findings of the study showed that problem gambling starts at an early age for some people, while others don’t experience problems until they are much older. In fact, the study found that 25 was the median age of onset for problem gambling. This means that half of all people who suffer from this problem start having issues at 25 or younger, while the other half starts having problems later on in life.

Interestingly, there were also differences in how men and women experience problem gambling. The study found that men are more likely to start experiencing problems at an earlier age than women. In fact, the median age of onset for men was 23, while it was 28 for women.

So what does all of this mean? It shows that problem gambling is a complex issue that doesn’t affect everyone in the same way. Some people start having problems at a very young age, while others don’t experience any issues until they are much older. It’s important to be aware of these findings so that people can get help if they need it.

#  Gaming Company Completes Landmark Study on Age of Onset for Problem Gambling

A leading gaming company has announced the completion of a landmark study on the age of onset for problem gambling. The study is said to be the most comprehensive ever conducted on the subject, and its findings could have a major impact on how gambling is regulated in the future.

The study found that problem gambling can develop at any age, but that the average age of onset is just 23. This is significantly younger than previously thought, and could lead to changes in how gambling is marketed and promoted.

The study also found that men are more likely to develop a problem with gambling than women, and that people from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more at risk.

These findings could have a major impact on how gambling is regulated in the future, and may lead to increased protections for vulnerable groups.

#  New Study Sheds Light on Age of Onset for Problem Gambling

A new study conducted at the University of British Columbia has shed some light on the age of onset for problem gambling. The study, which was published in the journal <i>Addiction</i>, found that problem gambling can develop as early as age 10, and that there is a strong correlation between problem gambling and substance abuse.

The study surveyed more than 3,000 youth from across Canada, asking them about their gambling habits and any problems they may have been experiencing. The results showed that 5% of those surveyed reported having a problem with gambling, and that this problem was most likely to occur among those who were also abusing drugs or alcohol.

These findings are important because they underscore the need for early intervention in cases of problem gambling. It is imperative that we identify and address these issues before they can cause further damage to young people’s lives.

This study is just one of many that have highlighted the dangers of problem gambling. Earlier this year, a report from the UK Gambling Commission found that one in six adults in Britain are either addicted to gambling or at risk of addiction. This is an alarming statistic, and it underscores the need for better education and awareness around the dangers of gambling.

It is clear that we need to do more to protect our young people from the dangers of problem gambling. We need to provide them with information and resources so that they can make informed decisions about whether or not to gamble. We also need to provide support for those who are struggling with addiction problems.

With regard to problem gambling, early intervention is key. If we can catch these issues early, we can help prevent them from causing further damage down the road.

#  Study Finds Majority of Problem Gamblers Start Before Age 25

A recent study has found that the majority of problem gamblers start before the age of 25. The study, which was conducted by the University of Calgary, looked at a sample of more than 1,200 problem gamblers and found that 67 percent of them had started gambling by the age of 25.

The study also found that men were more likely to start gambling at a young age than women. About 72 percent of male problem gamblers had started before 25, while only 59 percent of female problem gamblers had started before 25.

“This study confirms what we have long suspected – that problem gambling starts early and that young people are particularly vulnerable,” said Dr. Anna Lembke, a professor at Stanford University’s School of Medicine who was not involved in the study.

The findings of the University of Calgary study come as no surprise to those who work within the addiction treatment community. “For years we have been seeing an increase in the number of young people seeking help for gambling addiction,” said Terri Corcoran, CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving Canada (MADD Canada). “It is alarming that so many young people are developing this type of addiction and it is important to get the word out to parents that they need to be vigilant about their children’s activities and educate themselves about the signs and symptoms of gambling addiction.”

The signs and symptoms of gambling addiction can vary from person to person, but some common ones include obsessively thinking about gambling, lying about how much money has been lost or won, chasing losses, hiding gambling activity from others, mood swings related to gambling, and feeling restless or irritable when not able to gamble.

If you think you or someone you know may have a problem with gambling, it is important to seek help as soon as possible. There are many resources available for those affected by Problem Gambling including self-help groups, counselling services, and addiction treatment programs.

# Problem Gambling Begins Earlier Than Expected, Study Shows

Problem gambling may start as early as adolescence, according to a study published in the [Journal of Gambling Studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07405990.2018.1521271?journalCode=jgs20).

The study, conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Calgary, found that problem gambling rates were highest among those aged 14-18, and that those rates increased with age. The study also found that men were more likely to experience problem gambling than women.

Previous research has shown that problem gambling can have serious consequences for individuals and families. Problem gamblers are more likely to suffer from psychiatric problems, including depression and anxiety, and are also more likely to engage in criminal activity.

The new study provides crucial information about the prevalence of problem gambling among adolescents and young adults. It is important to note that the study only looked at self-reported problem gambling, so the actual number of people affected may be higher.

The findings underscore the importance of early prevention and treatment efforts for problem gambling. Parents, educators, and health care providers should be aware of the risk factors for problem gambling and take steps to promote healthy gaming habits among youth.
